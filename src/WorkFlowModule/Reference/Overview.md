# Core Architecture

## Event-Driven Pipeline System

These platforms follow an event-driven architecture where data flows through a series of connected nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each workflow is essentially a pipeline that processes data step by step.

## Node-Based Visual Programming

The fundamental building block is the "node" - a self-contained unit that performs a specific function. Users drag and drop nodes onto a canvas and connect them to create workflows.
- Each node is defined independently from other like `/WorkFlowModule/Nodes/{NodeName}/{Types.tsx, Service.tsx, API.tsx, }
## Node Structure and Types

### Node Categories:

* **Trigger Nodes**: Start workflows (webhooks, schedules, file watchers, API polling)
* **Action Nodes**: Perform operations (API calls, data transformation, file operations)
* **Logic Nodes**: Control flow (conditions, loops, switches, filters)
* **Data Nodes**: Handle data manipulation (merge, split, aggregate, format)

### Node Internal Structure:

* **Input/Output Schema**: Defines expected data format
* **Configuration Panel**: User-configurable parameters
* **Execution Logic**: The actual operation performed
* **Error Handling**: How failures are managed
* **Authentication**: OAuth, API keys, connection credentials

## Data Flow Mechanism

### Execution Context:

Each node receives an execution context containing:

* Input data from previous nodes
* Workflow metadata
* Environment variables
* Authentication tokens
* Error state information

### Data Format:

Data typically flows as JSON objects with standardized structure

## Workflow Execution Engine

### Execution Models:

* **Sequential**: Nodes execute one after another
* **Parallel**: Multiple branches execute simultaneously
* **Conditional**: Execution path depends on data/conditions
* **Loop**: Iterative processing of data sets

### State Management:

* Workflow state tracking
* Node execution status
* Data persistence between steps
* Resume capability for long-running workflows

## Technical Architecture Layers

### Frontend (Visual Editor):

* Canvas-based drag-and-drop interface
* Node library/palette
* Real-time execution monitoring
* Debugging tools and logs
* Connections, Flows, Implementations, Fallback, etc

## Key Design Patterns

### Plugin Architecture:

Nodes are essentially plugins that conform to a standard interface, making the system extensible.

### Microservice Pattern:

Each integration/node can be developed and deployed independently.

### Event Sourcing:

Workflow executions are often logged as a series of events for debugging and replay.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern:

Prevents cascading failures when external services are down.

## Data Transformation Pipeline

### Input Validation:

* Schema validation
* Data type checking
* Required field verification

### Processing:

* Data mapping and transformation
* Business logic execution
* External API calls

### Output Formatting:

* Response normalization
* Error standardization
* Next node preparation
